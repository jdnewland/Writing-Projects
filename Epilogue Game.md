## **Overview**

The Epilogue is divided into **two major parts**:

- **Part One (Years 1–5)**: Immediate personal outcomes and early impacts.
    
- **Part Two (Years 5–100)**: Broader consequences, long-term legacies, and world-shaping events.
    

At the end of Part Two, each player narrates a short **Final Word**, providing closure or leaving open threads for future adventures.

## **Action Points (AP)**

At the start of each part, players roll dice to determine their available **Action Points**:

| Legacy Part                | AP Roll     | Description                                |
| -------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Part One** (Years 1–5)   | **2d6 + 1** | Short-term, personal story developments.   |
| **Part Two** (Years 5–100) | **3d6 + 1** | Broad, historical, world-shaping outcomes. |

Players spend AP to take narrative actions each round in initiative order, continuing until:

- All players spend all AP, OR
    
- All players agree unanimously to move forward.

## **Action Point Escalation**

**Each time you choose a specific narrative action within the same part, the AP cost of that action increases by +1.**

- For example:
    
    - First **Deed** costs **1 AP**
        
    - Second **Deed** costs **2 AP**
        
    - Third **Deed** costs **3 AP**, etc.
        

Costs reset at the start of each new Legacy Part.

## **Narrative Actions (Parts One and Two)**

Choose from these actions, keeping in mind the escalating AP costs:

| Action                | Initial AP Cost | Description                                                                                       |
| --------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Do a Deed**         | **1 AP**        | Perform a meaningful personal act—heroic, political, spiritual, or emotional.                     |
| **Accomplish a Goal** | **1 AP**        | Fulfill a personal ambition—revenge, family, wealth, or political power.                          |
| **Create a Problem**  | **1 AP**        | Introduce a complication, enemy, or unresolved issue tied to your choices.                        |
| **Life Change**       | **1 AP**        | Experience a major transformation—career change, retirement, betrayal, disappearance, or rebirth. |
| **Affect Another**    | **2 AP**        | Dramatically influence another character’s storyline. The affected player narrates the outcome.   |

- **Veto Rule (Affect Another):**  
    Any player can request a vote if the action is uncomfortable or negatively impacts fun. A majority cancels the action and refunds AP.

## **Legacy Traits**

At the **end of each Legacy Part**, players earn **Legacy Traits** as rewards, reflecting how history remembers their characters.

**Assigning Legacy Traits:**

1. Review each player's narrative actions.
    
2. Assign one or two traits per player that best represent their impact.
    
3. Record traits clearly; these permanently define historical memory.
    

**Example Traits:**

| Legacy Trait  | Awarded for Actions Like…                                          |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Heroic**    | Frequent heroic deeds or self-sacrifice.                           |
| **Infamous**  | Notable betrayals, scandals, or creating serious problems.         |
| **Legendary** | Actions leading to lasting myths or cultural impact.               |
| **Haunted**   | Major tragedies or unresolved emotional conflicts.                 |
| **Visionary** | Groundbreaking institutions, discoveries, or innovations.          |
| **Cursed**    | Dark deeds, repeated tragedy, or association with forbidden magic. |

Feel free to collaborate and create additional traits to perfectly fit your characters’ legacies.
